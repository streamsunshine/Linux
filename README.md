# Linux

My linux is ubuntu, there are some differences with redhat that was described by Vbird in his book, so I would like to record some **differences between redHat and ubuntu** here, I arm tired of searching the same things again and again.

My ubuntu has broken twice because I uninstall some software. I search a lot for it, I hope I can learn from my broken OS. You know, keep writing is a good way. So I will recorf some **bugs and solution**, I hope I can fix system quickly by this way.

Although I search the solutions for fixing my system, I just do what the solutions want me to do, I do not know why and how, it always makes the situation worse. So I will record some **basics about linux and ubuntu**, I hope I can learn more by this way.

I have a repository about linux configuration, I hope I can intergrate it into this repository one day!
